## Intro
To prep for my upcoming interview, I am documenting my codes, thought process and learnings as I code through the Top Interview 150 questions on LeetCode.

## Arrays/Strings
### 88. Merge Sorted Array - two pointers, Sorting
**Question:**\
Merge `nums1` and `nums2`, both in increasing order, with length `m` and `n`. Final result is not returned and merge should be done in-place at `nums1`, where it has a length of `m+n`. 

**Algorithm:**\
As a first thought, since both lists are sorted, we can merge both lists by comparing element of each list in increasing order. Create a pointer for each list, iterate through nums1, compare smallest element of each, add smallest in-place at nums1. 
This creates a problem because as we iterate through the list, element that not yet compared can be replaced in-place by previous comparison. So we should iterate from decreasing order from right to left of the list. 

**Code:**\
O(m+n) and O(1)
```
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        i = m-1 # pointer of nums1
        j = n-1 # pointer of nums2
        k = m+n-1 # k elements total

        while j >= 0:
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                i -= 1

            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                j -= 1
            k -= 1
```

### 27. Remove Element
**Question:**\
Remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. Order may be changed. Return # of elements in `nums` that are NOT equal to `val`.

**Algorithms:**\
First thought, iterate through nums, check if element equal or not equal to val, if not equal, then continue with next iteration; if equals, then replace this element with the result from next iteration. This works because in-place replacement are always behind the iteration, no element that are yet to be compared will be in-place replaced.

**Code:**\
O(n) and O(1)
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        k = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
        return k
```

### 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
**Question:**\
Given `nums` sorted in increasing order, remove duplicates in-place such that each unique element apperas only once. The relative order of the elememts should be kept the same. Return number of unque elements.

**Algorithms:**\
As a first thought, since array is sorted, during iteration, keep track of current duplicate, if the element from next iteration is same as current duplicate, then a duplicate is found. Also add a index pointer k, to keep track of current in-place replacement index.

**Code:**\
O(n) and O(1)
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        duplicate = nums[0]
        k = 1

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != duplicate:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
            duplicate = nums[i]
        return k
```

### 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
**Question:**\
Same as question above, except the unique element appears at most twice.

**Algorithms:**\
Same algorithm as above, except add a variable `freq` to track if the duplicate apperas at most twice

**Code:**\
O(n) and O(1)
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        duplicate = nums[0]
        k = 1
        freq = 1

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != duplicate:
                freq = 1
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
            else:
                freq += 1
                if freq <= 2:
                    nums[k] = nums[i]
                    k += 1
            duplicate = nums[i]
        return k
```

### 169. Majority Elememt
**Question:**\
Given an array `nums` of size n, return the majority element

**Algorithms:**\
First try, majority element is the element that appears more than lower(n/2) times, we can sort the array, iterate from low to high, keep track of the number of duplicate elements and whether its appearnce is greater than lower(n/2).

Second try, question asked for a O(n) and O(1) solution, but sorting will take O(nlogn). Instead of sorting, create a dictionary, element as the index, count as its values, and find the argmax of the max count.

Third try, create a variable `count` and a variable `candidate`, iterate the array, if element equals candidate, then count plus 1, if not, count minus 1.
The count keeps track of number of unique elements.

**Code:**\
O(nlogn) and O(1)
```
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # sort
        nums.sort() # O(nlogn)

        n = len(nums)
        threshold = n//2
        duplicate = nums[0]
        count = 1


        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]

        # iteration
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] == duplicate:
                count += 1
                if count > threshold:
                    return nums[i]
            else:
                count = 1 
            duplicate = nums[i]
```

O(n) and O(n)
```
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        # m = defaultdict(int)
        m = {key: 0 for key in nums}
        for num in nums:
            m[num] += 1
        for key, value in m.items():
            if value > n//2:
                return key
```

O(n) and O(1)
```
  count = 0
        candidate = 0
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
                count += 1
            elif num == candidate:
                count += 1
            elif num != candidate:
                count -= 1
        return candidate
```
